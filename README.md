Welcome to the Vote-Vault!

* SSDpressed - Vote Vault - The system needs to automate the voting process, while also making sure the votes are
  valid and secure. The voting system will make use of a blockchain and Smart Contracts
  to save and verify user votes. The system will be available to users on the web or in the
  form of a mobile application. The votes will be verified by scanning voter IDs, then users
  will be allowed to vote. Votes will be verified and counted using the blockchain. Users
  will be able to see progress on the voting system. Instead of hard coding forms for
  elections, it should be dynamically generated according to input provided by the voting
  official. A dashboard should be made to give some additional information about the
  voting process, such as distributions about the users.
