          To register for an upcoming election you can do one of
          following two things:<br><br>
          1. Go to your local voting station and let a voting official
          register you.<br>
          2. Register yourself through the VoteVault app.<br><br>
          To register yourself you need to download the VoteVault app
          and enter your name, surname and ID number. You will also need to
          scan the barcode on the back of your ID. After the scan is complete
          you can press the "Register Now" button.<br><br>

          The system will check to see if the information you entered is
          correct and whether you are already registered. If the information
          is correct a message will pop up saying you have successfully been registered.
          <br><br>Now you just need to wait for the election day and go vote.

          When the day of the election has arrived you can either go
          to your local voting station or you can vote remotely from
          the VoteVault App.<br><br>

          To vote remotely you first need to have registered for the election
          as specified above. After you have registered the app will prompt you
          to enter your ID again, after which you will be taken to the voting
          page.<br><br>
          On the voting page you will be shown the first ballot of the election.
          Select the candidate you wish to vote for. If there are more than one
          ballots you will be taken to the next ballot where you will need to
          select the next candidate you wish to vote for.<br><br>

          After the last ballot you will get a prompt to submit your votes.
          After you press the button your votes will be cast and you will NOT be
          able to vote for the current election again.
