    <div class="Details">
      To register for an upcoming election you can do one of 
      following two things:<br><br>
      1. Go to your local voting station and let a voting official
      register you.<br>
      2. Register yourself through the VoteVault app.<br><br>
      To register yourself you need to download the VoteVault app 
      and enter your name, surname and ID number. You will also need to
      scan the barcode on the back of your ID. After the scan is complete
      you can press the "Register Now" button.<br><br>
      The system will check if you entered valid information and will check 
      if you have already registered or not. If you have not registered yet, 
      and your information is correct, a message will pop up  saying that 
      you are successfully registred.
